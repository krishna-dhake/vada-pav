Boil 2 large potatoes, about 350 grams. Peel and then mash them with a fork in a bowl.(You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, Instant pot or pressure cooker. Remember to drain the water very well from the boiled potatoes before you mash them.)
Heat 2 to 3 teaspoons oil in a small pan. Add ½ tsp mustard seeds and crackle them. Then add 7 to 8 curry leaves and asafetida (hing). Stir and sauté for about 5 seconds.
Then add 6 to 7 small to medium-sized garlic and 1 to 2 green chilies, which have been crushed in a mortar-pestle. Add ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder.
Stir until the raw aroma of garlic goes away.
Pour this tempering in the mashed potatoes.
Add 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Also add salt as required.
Mix everything well. Then make small to medium balls from the mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and keep aside.
In another bowl, make a smooth batter from 1 to 1.25 cups besan (gram flour), ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder, a pinch of asafoetida, a pinch of baking soda (optional), salt and ½ cup water.(The batter should not be too thick or thin. If the batter becomes thin, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of gram flour. If the batter becomes thick, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons water.)
Dip the slightly flattened potato balls in the batter and coat it evenly with the batter.
Gently drop these batter coated potato balls in medium hot oil.
